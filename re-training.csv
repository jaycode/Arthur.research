With views of the towering triple sided old world stone fireplace, grand entry, colossal great room, and built-in wine bar, entertaining is a delight. Although the home is magnificent in size, each area offers a warm tranquil experience to reflect with the connection of uniting the two natural environments, the home and nature.
