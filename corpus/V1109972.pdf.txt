Perched atop a dramatic hillside, this contemporary rancher capitalizes on a stunning setting with its simple and beautiful design. The 4600 square foot home sits on 2.06  acres alongside a picturesque 25-foot waterfall amidst mature trees, with spectacular views of the Tantalus Range. A grand approach brings you to the front entrance,  nestled between the home's two wings. To the right, five bedrooms await family and friends, with dual masters and an ensuite for each space, and to the left, open concept  living, media room and access out to the expansive private terrace. The Sundance was designed by North Architecture and built by Vision Pacific, leaders in modern  mountain estates.
