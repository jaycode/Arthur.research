The majestic crown jewel of the Okanagan  Big White Ski Resort with 10,000 square feet of luxurious living space, hand crafted by Pioneer Log Homes. The Award  Winning, White Spirit Lodge is considered to be one of the most beautiful log homes in the World. It was designed around massive old growth cedar logs rescued and  salvaged from storms, oceans, and fires. All the logs were hand scribed to reveal their true beauty and eternal history of the tree. With a castle appearance in mind, Rundle  stones were selected to give texture and strength and add to the mountainous feel. The heart of this home was created to enable conversation to easily flow and allow a  view-orientated design to accentuate the consistent seamless connection with Mother Nature. With views of the towering triple sided old world stone fireplace, grand  entry, colossal great room, and built-in wine bar, entertaining is a delight. Although the home is magnificent in size, each area offers a warm tranquil experience to reflect  with the connection of uniting the two natural environments, the home and nature. The White Spirit Lodge has been gifted with every upgrade imaginable from Cherry  Cabinetry, Golden Granite, Sub Zero & Wolf Appliances, Black African Walnut Floors, Cobalt Glass Sinks to mirror the illusion of water, Bronze dual-tiered chandeliers,  custom made timber and stone staircases with motion sensored lighting that captures a Dungeness theme.
