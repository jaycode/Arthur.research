Bold in stature, staring out across the Heritage Pointe Golf course, none assuming from the street positioned at the end of a fingerlet from the cul-de-sac, this custom post  and beam home floods its open space design through 14 skylights and massive windows. Visitors are awed by two large granite islands squaring off against each other,  serving a nook, casual dining or outdoor kitchen, on one of three decks. All five bedrooms are ensuited, two with their own private entrances, one with its own spiral  staircase, library room & fireplace and the stately master with island fireplace, private den and sitting area. A large flared staircase opens to the lower receiving area  providing guests a choice to the multi tiered theatre or party room with large elbow bar and dance floor, the saloon room, as it has become known, still reverberates with  country music. On a quieter note slip inside the wine room and select your favorite glass to be enjoyed in the sipping area. Entertainment is not an option. Spectacular  private setting situated at Heritage Pointe Golf Course. This home and property is truly one of a kind.
