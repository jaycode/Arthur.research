Description
Old world elegance prevails in this stone built waterfront estate located in the heart of Rothesay, New Brunswick on the spectacular Kennebecasis River. Handsome details  enrich the well proportioned rooms with primary living space arranged for expansive river views and outdoor living and incredible sunsets. An almost unheard of 4.5 acre  site where private sandy beach front (250 feet) on Cudlips Cove affords deep water anchorage in your backyard. Here, a rare opportunity to make this your family address  for generations to come: golf course, private schools and the centre of town a short walk away.
