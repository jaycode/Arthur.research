A piece of paradise along the shores of Okanagan Lake with over 500 feet of private and pristine waterfront. 2 homes that are architecturally designed and timelessly  styled. The main home taking full advantage of the lakeside setting. Mature indigenous trees and landscaping, impressive rock walls and numerous patios and plateaus to  enjoy the setting. Sandy beach area with licensed dock, boat moorage and areas to enjoy the Okanagan sunshine. The second home is nestled apart from the main home  and is ideal for visiting family and guests. The upper portion of the property offers a unique opportunity for potential subdivision, detached garage & shop. Just minutes  from Cedar Creek Estate Winery, Summer Hill Winery, Bertram Beach and Okanagan Mountain Park. Your guests will enjoy the scenic drive through the vineyards along  the shoreline of Okanagan Lake. Picturesque sunset views, nature at your doorstep and peaceful quiet are just some of the memories you will enjoy. Fabulous business  asset to be used as a corporate retreat and client meetings.
