Perched on a ridge-top high above the word-class golf resort of SilverTip, this 7,880 sqft, 4 bedroom + den, 8 bath, timber-frame masterpiece is impressive in every  measurable way. Highlighting its pride-of-place, stunning views of rugged peaks are visible at every turn, through massive windows & awe-inspiring vaults. Clad in stone,  copper & locally sourced wood. The finest finishes from the likes of Viking, Kohler & Hansgrohe. Richly prepared surfaces in Pennsylvania bluestone, hand-planed walnut,  natural rundlestone & cherrywood. Each level of the home suits a different purpose, thoughtfully executed to make the most of its environment. A master level, quietly set  above all & master bath comparable to a private luxury spa; family level, games & media room, gym, resistance pool, steamroom & more. With so many features, this  narrative should only serve to whet the appetite of the reader & can be expanded upon with a first-hand visit by only the most discerning & well-qualified buyers.
