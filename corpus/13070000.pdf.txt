Description
This spectacular north shore architectural gem, sits on a bluff facing the awesome expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. Nestled in the natural landscape of 11 acres, this 13,500  sq ft home was designed by a nationally renowned American architect who also oversaw every detail of construction. No expense was spared in the construction of this  home from the foundation of reinforced poured concrete to roof of Western red cedar; every effort was made to build a house meant to last generations. The exterior of  the house features Cape Cod siding & imported Pennsylvania field stone from Valley Forge Mountain. The stone walls as well as all of the patios are capped in  Pennsylvania flag stone, giving the house a natural feel that blends into the surrounding landscape. Windows are all Pella Architectural series windows. These solid wood  windows feature aluminum cladding on the exterior as well as Vivid View screens. Wow! Exciting YouTube HD Video attached.
